Submission instructions:

1. For this assignment, you should turn in 7 files:

• Six ‘.cpp’ files (for questions 1 – 6).

Name these files: ‘YourNetID_hw8_q1.cpp’, ‘YourNetID_hw8_q2.cpp’, etc.

• One ‘.pdf’ file (for questions 7 – 10).

Each question should start on a new page!

Name this file ‘YourNetID_hw8_q7to10.pdf’.

2. You should submit your homework in the Gradescope system.

Note that when submitting the pdf file, you would be asked to assign the pages from your file to their corresponding questions.

3. You can work and submit in groups of up to 4 people. If submitting as a group, make sure to associate all group members to the submission on gradescope.

4. Pay special attention to the style of your code. Indent your code correctly, choose meaningful names for your variables, define constants where needed, choose most suitable control statements, break down your solutions by defining functions, etc.

5. For the math questions, you are expected to justify all your answers, not just to give the final answer (unless explicitly asked to).

As a rule of thumb, for questions taken from zyBooks, the format of your answers, should be like the format demonstrated in the sample solutions we exposed.

Question 1:

1. Implement the function: int minInArray(int arr[], int arrSize)

This function is given arr, an array of integers, and its logical size, arrSize. When called, it returns the minimum value in arr.

2. Write a program that reads from the user a sequence of 20 integers (unnecessarily different from one another) into an array, and outputs the minimum value, and all the indices it appears in the array.

Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following example: Please enter 20 integers separated by a space:

14 5 12 5 6 14 5 12 14 12 14 6 8 7 5 136 9 2189 10 6

The minimum value is 5, and it is located in the following indices: 1 3 6 14

2:

A palindrome is a word, which reads the same backward or forward. For example, noon, civic, radar, level, rotor, kayak, reviver, racecar, redder, madam, and refer are all palindromes. a. Implement a function:

bool isPalindrome(string str)

This function is given a string str containing a word, and returns true if and only if str is a palindrome.

b. Write a program that reads a word from the user and announces to the user if it is a palindrome or not.

Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following example: Please enter a word: level level is a palindrome

Question 3:

Implement following functions:

a. void reverseArray(int arr[], int arrSize)

That takes arr, an array of integers, and its size, arrSize. When called, it reorders the elements of the array to appear in a reverse order.

For example, if arr is an array containing [1, 2, 3, 4], after calling reverseArray, arr will look like: [4, 3, 2, 1].

b. void removeOdd(int arr[], int&amp; arrSize)

That takes arr, an array of integers, and its size, arrSize. When called, the function alters arr so that the only numbers in it at the end are the even ones, which should remain in their original relative order.

Additionally, the function updates arrSize so it contains the new logical size of the array after removing the odd numbers (note that arrSize is a parameter used both for input and output).

For example, if arr is an array containing [1, 2, 3, 4], after calling removeOdd, arr will look like: [2, 4], and the parameter arrSize will update to 2. Notice the values in arr[2] and arr[3] are discarded.

c. void splitParity(int arr[], int arrSize)

That takes arr, an array of integers, and its size, arrSize. When called, the function changes the order of numbers in arr so that all the odd numbers will appear first, and all the even numbers will appear last. Note that the inner order of the odd numbers and the inner order of the even numbers don’t matter.

For example, if arr is an array containing [1, 2, 3, 4], after calling splitParity, arr could look like: [3, 1, 2, 4].

Implementation requirements:

1. In all three functions, you are not allowed to use an auxiliary array (a temporary local array).

2. Pay attention to the running time of your functions. For each one of the functions above, an efficient implementation would run in a linear time (that is Θ(𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒)).

#include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std;

void printArray(int arr[], int arrSize);

int main() {

int arr1[10] = {9, 2, 14, 12, -3}; int arr1Size = 5;

int arr2[10] = {21, 12, 6, 7, 14}; int arr2Size = 5;

int arr3[10] = {3, 6, 4, 1, 12}; int arr3Size = 5;

reverseArray(arr1, arr1Size); printArray(arr1, arr1Size);

removeOdd(arr2, arr2Size); printArray(arr2, arr2Size);

splitParity(arr3, arr3Size); printArray(arr3, arr3Size);

return 0;

}

void printArray(int arr[], int arrSize){ int i;

for (i = 0; i &lt; arrSize; i++) { cout&lt;&lt;arr[i]&lt;&lt;‘ ‘;

} cout&lt;&lt;endl;

}

When running this program you should expect the following output (the output for splitParity could be different):

-3 12 14 2 9

12 6 14

1 3 6 4 12

4:

Traditional password entry schemes are susceptible to “shoulder surfing” in which an attacker watches an unsuspecting user enter their password or PIN number and uses it later to gain access to the account. One way to combat this problem is with a randomized challengeresponse system. In these systems the user enters different information every time, based on a secret in response to a randomly generated challenge.

For example, consider an actual PIN number of 12345. To authenticate the user would be presented with a screen such as:

PIN: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

NUM: 3 2 3 1 1 3 2 2 1 3

The user would enter 23113 instead of 12345. This doesn’t divulge the password even if an attacker intercepts the entry because 23113 could correspond to other PIN numbers, such as

69440 or 70439.

The next time the user logs in, a different sequence of random numbers would be generated, such as:

PIN: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

NUM: 1 1 2 3 1 2 2 3 3 3

Write a program to simulate the authentication process. Store an actual 5-digit PIN number in your program (make one up, and store it as a constant). The program should use an array to assign random numbers to the digits from 0 to 9. Output the random digits to the screen, input the response from the user, and output whether or not the user’s response correctly matches the PIN number.

Assuming that the actual PIN number is 12345, your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following examples (2 different executions of the program):

Please enter your PIN according to the following mapping:

PIN: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

NUM: 3 2 3 1 1 3 2 2 1 3

23113

Your PIN is correct

Please enter your PIN according to the following mapping:

PIN: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

NUM: 1 1 2 3 1 2 2 3 3 3

23113

Your PIN is not correct

Note: Think how to break down your implementation to functions.

Question 5:

Write a program that reads a person’s name in the following format: first name, then middle name or initial, and then last name. The program then outputs the name in the following format:   Last_Name, First_Name Middle_Initial.

For example, the input   Mary Average User should produce the output:

User, Mary A.

The input  Mary A. User   should also produce the output:

User, Mary A.

Note that your program should work the same and place a period after the middle initial even if the input did not contain a period.

Question 6:

Write a program that reads in a line of text and outputs the line with all the digits in all integer numbers replaced with ‘x’.   Please enter a line of text:

My userID is john17 and my 4 digit pin is 1234 which is secret

My userID is john17 and my x digit pin is xxxx which is secret

Notes:

1. If a digits is part of a word, then the digit is not changed to an ‘x’. For example, john17 is NOT changed to johnxx.

3. Think how to break down your implementation to functions.
